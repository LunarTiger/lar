<h2>So, if the app generates links for you, why did you make this??</h2>
<p>I've noticed that when sharing links the bots of whatever site is used will usually invalidate the link by viewing it. Also, when a link is generated with the app it is very long, but the only thing that is needed is the last 4 characters. So, to combat these problems I've made this simple site. By using the link https://tiny.cc/lar combined with a # and characters it will direct to the site. For example: https://c.lovense-api.com/t2/<mark>1234</mark> would become https://tiny.cc/lar#<mark>1234</mark></p>
